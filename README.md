# Violence Detection Project

This project is designed to detect violence in videos using machine learning and computer vision techniques. It leverages state-of-the-art models and libraries to analyze video frames and classify them as violent or non-violent.

## Features
- Preprocessing of video data.
- Feature extraction using deep learning models.
- Classification of video frames.
- Visualization of results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/violence_detection_project.git
    cd violence_detection_project
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Requirements

The `requirements.txt` file includes the following dependencies:
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **opencv-python**: For video and image processing.

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by placing video files in the `data/` directory.
2. TODO
